/**
 * How to reverse Java String using Iteration and Recursionif you are from C background and new to Java then you get surprise that java
 * Strings are not character array instead they are object and Strings in Java are not null terminated but still you can use your C skill to
 * write iterative reverse function for string by getting character array by calling String.toCharArray() and getting length of String by
 * calling String.length(). Now if you succeed in writing String reverse function, an iterative version without using StringBuffer reverse
 * than they finally ask you to write a recursive one. Since recursion is a tricky concept and not many Java developer think recursive as
 * compared to C++ dudes, you may see many of Java programmer stuck here by doing doodling around subString, indexOf etc. So its better to
 * prepare in advance. here I have given example of reversing string using StringBuffer, iterative version of String reversal and reversing
 * string in Java using recursion. As I said recursive solution is always tricky to come up you need to found a suitable base case and than
 * repetitive call recursive method with each call reducing length of argument. anyway mine way is just one way of reversing string using
 * recursion, there are many solution out there. so donâ€™t forget to try out yourself.
